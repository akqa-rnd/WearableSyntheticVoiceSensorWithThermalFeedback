As AI starts to robustly understand and synthesise all manner of things, from human speech to the creative style of famous painters, we’re entering an era where anything that can be digitised can be mimicked by AI.

The [post-truth](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/post-truth#English) era is just getting started. Near the end of 2017 it’s possible we’ll be consuming content synthesised to mimic real people. Leaving us in a sea of disinformation powered by AI and machine learning. The media and [giant tech corporations](https://www.ft.com/content/0feeafe6-2c01-11e7-9ec8-168383da43b7) already struggle to discern fact from fiction. And as this technology is democratised it will be even more prevalent.

We see the ability to mimic anyone’s voice to say anything as a closing of the loop - if it [looks real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk) and [sounds real](https://lyrebird.ai/ethics), maybe it is real.     

FACE2FACE

To combat this we created a wearable device powered by a neural net trained on real and synthetic voices. Worn on the ear it is equiped with a thermal [peltier plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling) that, when a synthetic voice is detected, cools the skin to alert the wearer the voice they are hearing was synthesised, (by a cold and lifeless machine).

****A Powerful IoT Device****

To make this work we developed a custom circuit board using the tiny Simblee BLE chip, and an app to stream audio to a Tensor Flow application running a neural net trained on synthetic voices.

The irony is, the more technology improves the more adversarial it seems to become. Asking us fundamentally difficult questions. A great example being how to design software that chooses the best person/people to kill in a self driving car accident. The future holds countless more difficult questions posed by technological advances and we won’t be able to answer them all with more technology.
